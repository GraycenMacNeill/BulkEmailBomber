> ### Limitations:
> - Limited to 500 emails every 24 hours to prevent spam and ensure fair usage.
> - Maximum recipients per email: Gmail has a limit on the number of recipients you can include in a single email, including the "To," "CC," and "BCC" fields. This limit can vary but is typically around 100 recipients.
> - Blocked recipients: If you frequently send emails to recipients who mark them as spam, Gmail may limit your ability to send to those addresses.- Spam risk: Sending more than 100 emails at once could send them to the recipients spam folder.
> ### Security Concerns:
> - Your Google App Password is stored securely on Google cloud services ensuring the key remains private. Only users with full access to your Google account can use the App Password. Your Google password is personal and should be kept secret. Sharing it can lead to unauthorized access to your account.
